TO DO:::

planet affecting player the most needs to be the one targeted by the camera, not the closest

gravity improvements: fixing slide on terrain

fix player getting stuck on side in ground

teather system for damage for ship's central sphere

add camera zoom buffer

change constants for camera rotation

movement for background plane and sun based on distance in z from 0,0

improvements to lighting from sun

implement little line or particles following player's position to show velocity

fire y scales with time spent thrusting

fire rotation speed scales with velocity of the ship

DONE:::

Minimap using the two planets

All planets gravity affecting player
